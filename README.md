# Hi there üëã

Welcome to my GitHub profile! My name is Izaak Kuipers, an 18 year old fullstack developer focused solely on making programs accessible to the public for IT hobbyists and the like. I've been on GitHub since december 2020 and have nearly 300 repositories. I specialize in frontend development using **TS, CSS and Svelte**, and a ton **backend API's using TS** (NodeJS), **Go**, **C#**, **PHP** and **Socket.IO**. I also have a lot of **experience creating API's** and other applications using **C#**. In 2025 I'm going to revisit my life's work: it's time to truly push the limits of possibility.

# The streak is ending
It's been a nice run folks, but I've decided to stop it _soon_. I've been making daily commits since December 3rd 2023, and the time has come to choose what I value more: my mental health, friends and family and my social life, or spending hours of every day writing commits just to watch a square turn green on a graph, and to watch a number increase. Suffice to say, I'd much rather continue building my social life than have it rot away because I'm afraid of losing my silly GitHub streak.

**July 25th 2025** will be the last day of daily commits. On that day I will take a 1 week hiatus from programming altogether to let go of this habit, and to take the well deserved break people have been telling me to take for literally years. Why this date? Because it's the 600th day of the streak, a nice round number to end it with. I sure do love me some irony.

The end of the streak has been reached! My one week hiatus from programming starts now and ends in one week. See you then'
