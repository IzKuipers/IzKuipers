# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! My name is Izaak Kuipers, a 17 year old fullstack developer focused solely on making programs accessible to the public for IT hobbyists and the like. I've been on GitHub since december 2020 and have nearly 200 repositories. I specialize in frontend development using **TS, CSS and Svelte**, and a ton **backend API's using TS** (NodeJS), **Go**, **C#** and **Socket.IO**. I also have a lot of **experience creating API's** and other applications using **C#**. As a goal for 2024, I've begun learning the Rust programming language. See this developing skill in action in my second rust project found [here](https://github.com/IzKuipers/ArcOffload).
